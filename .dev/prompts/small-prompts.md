## Brainstorming & Conceptual

### Conceptual Gap-Filling
**Category**: Brainstorming, Conceptual Design  
**Tags**: `#gap-analysis` `#conceptual` `#brainstorming`  
**Use Case**: Identifying missing elements in system/process discussions

**When to use**: During impromptu conversations about system concepts and flow, not implementation details

**Prompt**:
```
I have a rough transcript or draft explanation of a system/process. It's incomplete, and I want to know what big-picture ideas or conceptual steps are still missing. Do not give me detailed technical sections. Instead, outline at a high level the themes, concepts, or flow elements that would still need to be discussed in order to wrap up a brainstorming or stand-up style conversation. Keep it in broad strokes (like user experience, publishing targets, system behavior), not in implementation specifics.
```

**Notes**: Good for spark chats and early-stage conceptual discussions

3. **Include the full prompt** in code blocks
4. **Add notes** about when/why to use it
5. **Update table of contents** if adding new categories
6. **Use consistent formatting** with existing entries

**Format Template**:
```markdown
