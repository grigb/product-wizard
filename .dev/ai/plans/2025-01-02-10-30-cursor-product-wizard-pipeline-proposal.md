# Product Wizard Pipeline: Universal Product Development Structure

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive file system structure for Product Wizard - a universal product development pipeline that transforms raw conversation transcripts into deployable software products. The system bridges the gap between unstructured ideation discussions and structured software development through a four-phase pipeline: Discovery → Specification → Refinement → Deployment.

## The Problem Statement

Traditional product development suffers from several critical gaps:

1. **Lost Knowledge**: Rich ideation discussions in meetings, calls, and conversations are rarely captured in actionable formats
2. **Disconnected Phases**: Discovery, development, and deployment phases operate in silos with poor knowledge transfer
3. **Junior Developer Bottleneck**: Complex product understanding gets trapped in senior team members' minds
4. **Inconsistent Documentation**: Product requirements emerge organically but lack systematic structure
5. **Spec Kit Integration Gap**: While Spec Kit provides excellent structured development, it lacks upstream integration for raw idea capture

## The Solution: Product Wizard Pipeline

Product Wizard creates a universal pipeline that transforms any product idea from "dream to deployment" through four interconnected phases:

### Phase 1: Discovery (Dream → Structured Ideas)
### Phase 2: Specification (Ideas → Spec Kit Integration)
### Phase 3: Refinement (Spec Kit → Production Ready)
### Phase 4: Deployment (Production → Release)

## Conclusion

The Product Wizard pipeline transforms product development from an ad-hoc, knowledge-intensive process into a structured, scalable system. By capturing the rich context of ideation discussions and systematically transforming them through proven development practices, it enables teams of any size to build better products faster while preserving the critical insights that drive product success.

This universal approach ensures that no good idea is lost, no requirement is misunderstood, and no deployment is unprepared - creating a complete pipeline from dream to deployment that scales with any organization's needs and grows smarter with each project completed.
