# Discovery Docs

**Purpose**: Source material for learning and building Product Wizard correctly.

This directory contains processes, concepts, conversations, and best practices captured from other projects, snapshots, and discussions. All materials here inform Product Wizard's design decisions and development approach.

## Directory Structure

- **`processes/`** - Captured workflows, methodologies, procedures
- **`concepts/`** - Ideas, frameworks, theories, mental models
- **`conversations/`** - Transcripts, discussions with others, meeting notes
- **`best-practices/`** - Proven approaches, patterns, what works
- **`snapshots/`** - Project snapshots, exports, system states

## Usage

### Adding Materials

When you have discovery material to add:

1. **Determine type** - Which subdirectory fits best?
2. **Use descriptive names** - `YYYY-MM-DD-source-topic.md` format
3. **Update INDEX.md** - Add entry so materials are discoverable
4. **Link relationships** - Cross-reference related materials

### Using for Decisions

Before making Product Wizard design decisions:

1. **Check relevant discovery docs** - What have we learned?
2. **Reference in discussions** - Link to specific materials
3. **Extract patterns** - What approaches work consistently?
4. **Document learnings** - Update best-practices as patterns emerge

## Relationship to Other Directories

- **`.dev/INBOX/`** - Temporary intake; process items into discovery-docs/
- **`.dev/ai/research/`** - AI-generated research (different from human discovery)
- **`.dev/notes/`** - Personal notes (different from reference material)

## Index

See `INDEX.md` for complete catalog of all discovery materials.
